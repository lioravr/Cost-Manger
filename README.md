# Cost-Manger -Stand Alone Application
cost manager desktop application that allows its users to track their expenses.

The project includes a standalone application that uses a relational database.

The application allow its users (at the minimum) the following operations:

1. Adding a new cost while specifying (at the minimum) the category to which that cost will be added, the sum, the currency, and a small text describing that cost.

2. Adding new categories to a small list of categories that should be already defined.

3. Getting a detailed report that lists all costs in a specific period of time the user selects.

In addition, the cost manager desktop application allow its users to register when they run the app for the first time, and to perform login/logout.

The desktop application will use a database (phpMyAdmin)and stored in the this database.

The UI developed using Swing. The architecture pattern used is MVVM.
